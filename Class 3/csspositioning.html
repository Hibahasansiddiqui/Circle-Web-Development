        <h2>Early Years</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Jinnah was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant, and his wife, Mithibai. His
        family was a member of the Khoja caste, Hindus who had converted to Islam centuries earlier and who were
        followers of the Aga Khan. There is some question about Jinnah’s date of birth: although he maintained that it
        was December 25, 1876, school records from Karachi (Pakistan) give a date of October 20, 1875.
        After being taught at home, Jinnah was sent in 1887 to the Sind Madrasat al-Islam (now Sindh Madressatul Islam
        University) in Karachi. Later he attended the Christian Missionary Society High School (also in Karachi), where
        at the age of 16 he passed the matriculation examination of the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai,
        in Mumbai, India). On the advice of an English friend, his father decided to send him to England to acquire
        business experience. Jinnah, however, had made up his mind to become a barrister. In keeping with the custom of
        the time, his parents arranged for an early marriage for him before he left for England.</p>

    <div class="second-div"> 
        <h2>Entry Into Politics</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>Jinnah first entered politics by participating in the 1906 session of the Indian National Congress (Congress
        Party) held at Calcutta (now Kolkata), in which the party began to split between those calling for dominion
        status and those advocating independence for India. Four years later he was elected to the Imperial Legislative
        Council—the beginning of a long and distinguished parliamentary career. In Bombay he came to know, among other
        important Congress Party personalities, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the eminent Maratha leader. Greatly influenced by
        those nationalist politicians, Jinnah aspired during the early part of his political life to become “a Muslim
        Gokhale.” Admiration for British political institutions and an eagerness to raise the status of India in the
        international community and to develop a sense of Indian nationhood among the peoples of India were the chief
        elements of his politics. At that time, he still looked upon Muslim interests in the context of Indian
        nationalism.
        But, by the beginning of the 20th century, the conviction had been growing among the Muslims that their
        interests demanded the preservation of their separate identity rather than amalgamation in the Indian nation
        that would for all practical purposes be Hindu. Largely to safeguard Muslim interests, the All-India Muslim
        League was founded in 1906. But Jinnah remained aloof from it. Only in 1913, when authoritatively assured that
        the league was as devoted as the Congress Party to the political emancipation of India, did Jinnah join the
        league. When the Indian Home Rule League was formed, he became its chief organizer in Bombay and was elected
        president of the Bombay branch.</p>

    <div class="third-div">
        <h2>Political Unity</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Jinnah’s endeavours to bring about the political union of Hindus and Muslims earned him the title of “the best
        ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity,” an epithet coined by Gokhale. It was largely through his efforts that the
        Congress Party and the Muslim League began to hold their annual sessions jointly, to facilitate mutual
        consultation and participation. In 1915 the two organizations held their meetings in Bombay and in 1916 in
        Lucknow, where the Lucknow Pact was concluded. Under the terms of the pact, the two organizations put their seal
        to a scheme of constitutional reform that became their joint demand vis-à-vis the British government. There was
        a good deal of give and take, but the Muslims obtained one important concession in the shape of separate
        electorates, already conceded to them by the government in 1909 but hitherto resisted by Congress.
        Meanwhile, a new force in Indian politics had appeared in the person of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi. Both the Home
        Rule League and the Congress Party had come under his sway. Opposed to Gandhi’s noncooperation movement and his
        essentially Hindu approach to politics, Jinnah left both the league and the Congress Party in 1920. For a few
        years he kept himself aloof from the main political movements. He continued to be a firm believer in
        Hindu-Muslim unity and constitutional methods for the achievement of political ends. After his withdrawal from
        Congress, he used the Muslim League platform for the propagation of his views. But during the 1920s the Muslim
        League, and with it Jinnah, had been overshadowed by Congress and the religiously oriented Muslim Khilafat
        movement.
        When the failure of the noncooperation movement and the emergence of Hindu revivalist movements led to
        antagonism and riots between Hindus and Muslims, the Muslim League began to lose strength and cohesion, and
        provincial Muslim leaders formed their own parties to serve their needs. Thus, Jinnah’s problem during the
        following years was to convert the Muslim League into an enlightened, unified political body prepared to
        cooperate with other organizations working for the good of India. In addition, he had to convince the Congress
        Party, as a prerequisite for political progress, of the necessity of settling the Hindu-Muslim conflict.
        To bring about such a rapprochement was Jinnah’s chief purpose during the late 1920s and early 1930s. He worked
        toward this end within the legislative assembly, at the Round Table Conference in London (1930–32), and through
        his “14 points,” which included proposals for a federal form of government, greater rights for minorities,
        one-third representation for Muslims in the central legislature, separation of the predominantly Muslim Sindh
        region from the rest of the Bombay province, and introduction of reforms in the North-West Frontier Province.
        His failure to bring about even minor amendments in the Nehru Committee proposals (1928) over the question of
        separate electorates and reservation of seats for Muslims in the legislatures frustrated him. He found himself
        in a peculiar position at that time: many Muslims thought that he was too nationalistic in his policy and that
        Muslim interests were not safe in his hands, while the Congress Party would not even meet the moderate Muslim
        demands halfway. Indeed, the Muslim League was a house divided against itself. The Punjab Muslim League
        repudiated Jinnah’s leadership and organized itself separately. In disgust, Jinnah decided to settle in England.
        From 1930 to 1935 he remained in London, devoting himself to practice before the Privy Council. But when
        constitutional changes were in the offing, he was persuaded to return home to head a reconstituted Muslim
        League.
        Soon preparations started for the elections under the Government of India Act of 1935. Jinnah was still thinking
        in terms of cooperation between the Muslim League and the Hindu-controlled Congress Party and with coalition
        governments in the provinces. But the elections of 1937 proved to be a turning point in the relations between
        the two organizations. Congress obtained an absolute majority in six provinces, and the league did not do
        particularly well. The Congress Party decided not to include the league in the formation of provincial
        governments, and exclusive all-Congress governments were the result. Relations between Hindus and Muslims
        started to deteriorate, and soon Muslim discontent became boundless.</p>

            <h2>Creator Of Pakistan</h2>
        </div>
    
    <p>Jinnah had originally been dubious about the practicability of Pakistan, an idea that the poet and philosopher
        Sir Muhammad Iqbal had propounded to the Muslim League conference of 1930, but before long he became convinced
        that a Muslim homeland on the Indian subcontinent was the only way of safeguarding Muslim interests and the
        Muslim way of life. It was not religious persecution that he feared so much as the future exclusion of Muslims
        from all prospects of advancement within India, as soon as power became vested in the close-knit structure of
        Hindu social organization. To guard against that danger, he carried out a nationwide campaign to warn his
        coreligionists of the perils of their position, and he converted the Muslim League into a powerful instrument
        for unifying the Muslims into a nation.</p>
